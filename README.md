# pydad - Machine Learning with Discharge Abstract Database using python

## Deprecated: Please use DADpy instead: https://github.com/E-Health/dadpy 

## About
DAD is a CIHI database of hospital admissions. This is an experiment with the DAD enhanced dataset to create a RandomForest model for predicting the total length of hospital stay (TLOS) based on the derived CMG fields added by Western U.

This is just a learning project for Apache Spark and Spark ML using pyspark. The accuracy of the model taking all derived categorical variables is only 20%.
